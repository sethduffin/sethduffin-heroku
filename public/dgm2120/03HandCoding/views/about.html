      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Shoe Crew is designed to combine everyoneâ€™s favorite shoes into one
        location. Here you can find all the latest trends and styles organized
        by brand and collection. Shoe Crew makes it easy by redirecting you to
        the actual sellers with one click. Eventually, you will be able to save
        your own collections and share them with friends.

        The owner, <strong>Seth Duffin</strong>, thought of the idea when he was
        having a hard time keeping track of when and where to find new shoe
        drops. Shoe crew takes care of this by providing that information all in
        one place. He hopes that others will take advantage of this tool and
        share with others the latest shoe finds!
